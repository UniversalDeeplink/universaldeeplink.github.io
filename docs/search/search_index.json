Deep Linking consists of using a uniform resource identifier (URI) that links to a specific location within a mobile app rather than simply launching the app. \" ( Mobile deep linking @ Wikipedia ) Domain Association is a similar feature but instead of using custom URIs ( mycustomuri://somecontent ) it utilizes Web URIs ( www.mydomain/somecontent ) to directly open your games on a specific location Each mobile platform has a specific name for this feature, iOS/tvOS calls it Universal Links , Android has its App links and Windows named it Uri handling , throughout this documentation we will refer the ability to associate a web URI with your game as Domain Association . We will be using our game Sudoku Zenkai ( iOS , Android , Windows and Steam ) as a use case throughout this documentation. Anyone that purchases the plugin in entitled to a free Steam key to check a live example of this plugin usage, to get it just contact us on our Discord channel or via mail Universal Deep Linking plugin enables your games to use Deep Linking on iOS, Android, Windows (UWP), tvOS, Windows, Mac, Linux and Steam (Linux, Mac, and Windows).

The plugin does not , however, create or configure the required files that you need to host on your website, nor the dev account configurations required to enables this capability on some platforms. The following configuration steps are only required if you wish to use the Domain Association feature, if you are only using Deep Linking, you can skip these steps. iOS/tvOS - Universal Links \u00b6 The first thing you will need to do is activate the Associated Domains service on your app id: Login on your Apple developer account in https://developer.apple.com/ In Identifiers -> App ID's, create or edit the app you wish to add Domain Association. Check the Associated Domains checkbox Save the changes After you added the Associated Domain service, your page should look like the following: From the above image, set-aside the Prefix and the ID . In Sudoku Zenkai case the Prefix is 5DVD99WQGR and the ID com.imaginationoverflow.com.sudokuzenkai . Now you need to create a json file named apple-app-site-association (no extension) with the following contents: { \"applinks\" : { \"apps\" : [], \"details\" : [ { \"appID\" : \"[PREFIX].[ID]\" , \"paths\" : [ \"*\" ] } ] } } With the file created you need to upload it to your website. The file should be accessible on either, the root or the .well-known directory: https://<your_domain>/.well-known/apple-app-site-association or https://<your_domain>/apple-app-site-association You can check Sudoku Zenkai and Loyca (other of our projects) association files on: http://sudokuzenkai.imaginationoverflow.com/apple-app-site-association http://loyca.imaginationoverflow.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association With the above configuration, you are telling the iOS that all links to your website should be opened in your game, you may wish to configure only a few paths, to do that you can check the official documentation . Finally, your site must be using HTTPS , if you don't have it this feature won't work! Android - App Links \u00b6 The first thing you need to configure the Domain Association is a package name , to configure that on your Unity Project click on Edit -> Project Settings -> Player . In the Android options you will find the Package Name setting: For more info on how to choose a package name checkout Google Documentation . The second thing you need to have is a keystore, you need to sign your game before submitting it to the store, you can get more info on Google documentation about this topic. After creating your keystore, you need to get SHA-256 certificate fingerprint , to do that just run the following command on your terminal (note the keytool comes with the Java SDK) : keytool -list -v -keystore mystorekeystore.keystore Running this command should yield something similar to the following image: With the package name and SHA-256 certificate fingerprint, you can finally create the digital asset link file, the filename should be assetlinks.json [{ \"relation\" : [ \"delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls\" ], \"target\" : { \"namespace\" : \"android_app\" , \"package_name\" : \"[MY_APP_PACKAGE_NAME]\" , \"sha256_cert_fingerprints\" : [ \"[SHA256_FINGERPRINT_FROM_KEYTOOL]\" ] } }] Finally you need to host the file on your website, it needs to be available on the root or .well-known directory. https://<your_domain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json or https://<your_domain>/assetlinks.json You can check Sudoku Zenkai and Loyca digital asset link on the following links: https://sudokuzenkai.imaginationoverflow.com/assetlinks.json https://loyca.imaginationoverflow.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json These files have optional configurations that you can use, for more info about these configurations check the official documentation .

This feature also enable direct deep linking testing on the Unity editor on Windows (Mac support coming soon). How to do redirect to store when app/game isn't installed? \u00b6 To achieve the redirect to store when the app isn\u2019t installed, you need two things, a website, and an app with Domain Association and deep linking. When the user clicks on a web link if the app is installed it will automatically open the app. If the app isn\u2019t installed, or the user chooses to open the link in the browser (both android and ios allow such choice) you can either: On your website automatically redirect the user to the store (not checking if the app is installed or not) Try to check if the app is installed, to achieve it you will need to: a) Try to redirect the user to your app deep link (myapp://), if the user has the app installed, it will either open automatically or ask the user if he wants to open it b) If it fails (e.g use a 3 seconds timeout), redirect to the store Warning This deep link behaviour can vary depending on the target platform and browser! My domain association isn't working. \u00b6 There are a couple of reasons why domain association can fail: Your website is not https, both Google and Apple require your website to be https Your apple-app-site-association (AASA) or assetlinks file isn't being served without redirects. Vendors require that your configuration file to be served without any redirects, in order to test this you can use any online http tool (e.g reqbin.com ) Your AASA file has incorrect appID configuration, double check it. Your assetlinks file has incorrect sha256_cert_fingerprints or package_name configuration. Your plugin integration is malfunctioning (although rare), to ensure that everything is working as expected, configure the plugin with a deep link and test it on an device. My app opens when I click a link/web link but nothing happens. \u00b6 The best way to double check everything, is run our demo scene on your target device and see if the activations appear as expected. In order to do this simply drag our scene to the Build Settings -> Scenes in Build , and place the Demo scene in the first position. This step is important since it ensures that the integration is working as expected. Possible issues that can cause this on your code are: The GameObject where you are making the LinkActivated registration is destroyed before any activation occurrs. We suggest you to do this configurations on DontDestroyOnLoad GameObjects. The GameObject where you are making the LinkActivated registration is yet to be created, to ensure this does not happen, place the event registration at your application boot phase. (Do note that the plugin caches the last request, so you can delay the activation as much as you wish). Your code is throwing an exception on the LinkActivated handler and it's failing silently, the plugin protects the handler activation with a try/catch block to avoid crashes, double check your logs, common issues we found throughout the years are: a) Trying to access a query string that doesn't exist. b) The GameObject not being ready to process a LinkActivated handler call, note that the plugin can fire the activation at the moment you register an handler if there is any requests cached. My Mac build isn't working, module/library not found on the logs \u00b6 If you are building via xcode, double check that the UniversalDeepLink.framework is present on the Build Phases -> Link Binary with Libraries . If not extract the zip under Assets\\Plugins\\ImaginationOverflow\\UniversalDeepLinking\\libs\\Standalone\\UniversalDeepLink.framework.zip to your xcode solution folder and add it to the linked libraries. Although rare this can happen on recently released xcode versions or when something fails(e.g missing permission) in the plugin automatic process. If you are building directly on Unity on a Mac, it's probably an optool issue (the tool we use to inject the library on your app), Assets\\Plugins\\ImaginationOverflow\\UniversalDeepLinking\\libs\\Tools\\optool . Ensure that the utility has execution permissions (on a terminal chmod +x optool) and on newer macOs versions follow this guide to allow unidentified apps to run Signing on macOS \u00b6 Our framework isn't signed for security and compatability reasons, so when you are submitting your project for apple store will be required to sign the UniversalDeepLink.framework . My deep link, domain association isn't working on app X \u00b6 The plugin works by registering your apps, on the target operating system, as a way to process some links (deep links or web links), there are cases of apps that open links internally on custom web views. These web views resolve any links internally not asking the target operating system on the best app to handle them. On these situations the plugin won't work as expected because the app X is bypassing the contract that allow deep linking and domain association to exist.

Unfortunately, neither you or we can do anything regarding these situations.","title":"My deep link, domain association isn't working on app X"},{"location":"GettingStarted/","text":"Using the Plugin \u00b6 The plugin uses a single event where you need to register in order to receive Deep Linking or Domain Association activations: void Start () { ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated += Instance_LinkActivated ; } private void Instance_LinkActivated ( ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . LinkActivation s ) { // // my activation code // } Never forget to remove your event registration when the GameObject where you registered it is destroyed : void OnDestroy () { ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated -= Instance_LinkActivated ; } The LinkActivated event will be triggered when your game is started or resumed by a Deep Link or Domain activation. The LinkActivated event single argument LinkActivation contains the Uri that triggered the game activation, a string with the raw Query String and a Dictionary with the query string already processed: public class LinkActivation { public string Uri { get ; private set ; } public string RawQueryString { get ; private set ; } public Dictionary < string , string > QueryString { get ; private set ; } } Consider the following example: private void Instance_LinkActivated ( ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . LinkActivation linkActivation ) { var url = linkActivation . Uri ; var querystring = linkActivation . RawQueryString ; var qParameter = linkActivation . QueryString [ \"q\" ]; } If Sudoku Zenkai is activated with the following link: https://sudokuzenkai.imaginationoverflow.com/puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl The variables values would be: url - https://sudokuzenkai.imaginationoverflow.com/puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl querystring - q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl qParameter - cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl If you have the game installed on your device right now, instead of using the site URI you can use the deep linking URI instead: sudokuzenkai://puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl You should be seeing the exact puzzle as seen below. Configuring the Plugin \u00b6 The configuration interface is under Window -> ImaginationOverflow -> Universal DeepLink Configuration On some platforms, the operating system asks the player what app she wishes to use after clicking a custom URI, the Display Name allows you to configure what name will the OS show on that occasion. The Steam App Id is for Steam only games, you can read about Steam integration on its section . The plugin allows you to configure the deep linking and domain association globally or per platform. Note The Standalone auto launcher features are exclusive to the Pro version of the plugin. Global Configuration \u00b6 If you are using the same custom URIs and Domains for every platform, you only need to setup it once and the plugin will automatically propagate all data to all platforms as you build for them. To configure a Deep Link or a Domain Association you need to provide: Scheme - it can be anything you wish, remember to check the Stores for other apps or games that are also using an URI you wish to adopt (when configuring for deep linking), for domain association it's usually http , if your site supports https add another entry to the list. Note : if you are thinking on redirecting a user to a deep link on the web, the scheme should always be configured in lower-case . Host - this parameter is usually only used for domain association, here you should put the host of your website Path - some platforms support which paths the application should be activated, but usually this is accomplished using other configuration files see Domain Association . Per Platform Configuration \u00b6 When you wish to override any configuration for a specific platform you can do that by clicking on the specific platform checkbox. After that, you just need to fill out the Deep Linking and Domain Association data or leave it empty if you do not wish to support these features for that specific platform. Note that by checking a platform none of the global configurations will be used for that specific platform. In the example above, we've changed the Android Deep Linking scheme to sudokuzenkaidroid and disabled the Domain Association capability. The remaining platforms will continue to use the global configurations. Testing \u00b6 After your game is deployed to a device, you can test the integration simply by clicking on a configured URI on any app or website. As an example, you can send yourself a message (on any messaging app) or an email with the proper URI. Editor \u00b6 Warning The editor debug window and direct deep link mock a link activation on the Unity editor, it bypasses any native platform integration and configuration. [ Pro Only ] Direct deep link testing \u00b6 In the plugin configuration window if you decide to enable Use for Unity debugging , the plugin will automatically redirect any configured deep link activations on your machine to the editor, enabling you to test the entire flow of information (for example OAuth flow) directly in the editor, without any further configuration. You can also use the run command in order to manually trigger deep links on your machine. The plugin will route them directly to your Unity Editor. Warning If you are working on Windows builds, the editor will replace the configuration of your already built game. To reconfigure the deep links simply open your game again. Debug Window \u00b6 We included a simple interface where you can test your deep linking activation without deploying, you can insert any valid and invalid URIs in order to test your integration. When you press Debug, the LinkActivated will be triggered and your callback called if the application is running in the editor. To simplify iteration we also store the last called deep/web links in order to streamline testing. On a Device \u00b6 Testing in a device can be done in many different ways, via messaging apps, email apps, etc. We recommend to use our online Test Tool , to use it simply follow the steps: On the device you wish to test open our Test Tool Type the deep link or web link you wish to test on the text box Click Create Click on Test After step 3 the website will update its url with the target test link information, making it easier to share test between team members or devices. iOS/tvOS \u00b6 Simulator \u00b6 After your game is installed on a simulator, open a terminal and run the following command: xcrun simctl openurl booted \"[MY_URI_HERE]\" Examples xcrun simctl openurl booted \"sudokuzenkai://puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl\" xcrun simctl openurl booted \"https://sudokuzenkai.imaginationoverflow.com/puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl\" Android \u00b6 Open a terminal on your development machine, open a terminal (console or powershell) and run the command: adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d \"[MY_URI_HERE]\" Examples adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d \"sudokuzenkai://puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl\" adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d \"https://sudokuzenkai.imaginationoverflow.com/puzzle?q=cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl\" Windows 10 \u00b6 You can use windows run program to test your integration, just click on the Windows Button and R and place your URI on the command option and press Ok . MacOS \u00b6 Open up a terminal and use the Open command: open [ MY_URI_HERE ] open sudokuzenkai://puzzle?q = cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl Linux \u00b6 On Linux you can use the xdg-open command to test your integration, open up a terminal and run the following command. xdg-open [ MY_URI_HERE ] xdg-open sudokuzenkai://puzzle?q = cMOiw5XDlsOXw5zDnMKl Standalone Caveats \u00b6 Build for MacOS \u00b6 If you make your Mac builds on MacOS the plugin will automatically configure everything that is required in order for it to work correctly. But if you make your MacOs build on Windows you will need to do some extra steps in order to fully configure your build to receive deep link activations. Due to Unity limitations, you will need a Mac or a MacOs VM in order to completely use the plugin capabilities. Building for MacOS on Windows \u00b6 When the build is completed you will note that the build process created an extra folder named UniversalDeepLinkingScripts . This folder contains all tools required to correctly finish up the plugin configuration: Copy the UniversalDeepLinkingScripts and your deliverable ( you_game.app ) to your Mac or VM. Open a Terminal and navigate to the copied items location. Run the setup.sh script: ./setup.sh If everything goes as expected you should see something similar to the following image: For more information on why you need to do this extra step check our Inside the Plugin Section . Linux and Windows \u00b6 On Windows and Linux standalone builds, the Deep Linking is only configured when the game runs the first time, so even if the player has the game installed on his machine, if he didn't play at least one time, the Deep Linking connection won't activate the game.

Overview \u00b6 The plugin content can be found inside the folder Plugins/ImaginationOverflow/UniversalDeepLinking , making easy to install and update when required. We included a simple Demo scene that allows you to test and play with the plugin before integrating it in your game. Inside the libs folder os all the required dlls in order for the plugin to work: ImaginationOverflow.UniversalDeepLinking.dll - Contains the public API of the plugin .Core.dll - Contains the core elements of the plugin .Editor.dll - Contains the windows and user interface of the plugin .Platform.dll - Contains the specific implementation for each platform, Android, iOS, UWP and Standalone. The Tools folder contains external tools that the plugin requires in order to work correctly, right now, the only external tool we are using is optool , required for MacOs builds. The plugin configurations are saved under Resources/ImaginationOverflow/UniversalDeepLink , facilitating the use of source control systems on development. This file is also required on some build targets at runtime, reason why it's directly under the Resources folder. Runtime \u00b6 At runtime the plugin creates a single GameObject and adds it to your current scene, this GameObject purpose is to ensure that all activation callbacks are called inside Unity main thread as well as propagate the pause events of the game to the plugin. The latter enables the plugin to refresh the activation data on some mobile platforms. Android \u00b6 The plugin handles all manifest registrations when you make a build, the plugin doesn't override the default activity enabling it to work with the most used plugins in the Asset Store. The Deep Linking and Domain Association activation is checked everytime the game is opened or resumed. iOS/tvOS \u00b6 The iOS integration uses a static library libUniversalDeepLink.a in order to receive information about the app activation. Just like on Android the plugin handles all registrations on info.plist and entitlements files. The library included in the plugin notifies it everytime the game was opened via deep link or domain association activation. Windows UWP (Windows Store Games) \u00b6 Just like the previous mobile platforms, the plugin automatically configures the Package.appxmanifest file with your configuration. In order for the plugin to work it edits the OnActivated event under App.xaml.cs , App.xaml.cpp or App.cpp depending on what Build Type (Xaml or D3D) and Scripting Backend (.NET or IL2CPP) you configure. The plugin should also work on Xbox UWP games but it was impossible to test on an actual console in order to get confirmation. Linux and Windows \u00b6 In Linux the deep link registration is done the first time the player opens the game . To accomplish this the plugin creates a Desktop File on the player machine, enabling the operating system to set up the game as a target of a custom protocol. On Windows , the game writes in the registry the information necessary to enable the OS to open the game every time the player clicks on a configured deep link URI. The protocol registration is also done everytime the Application.version is changed, enabling you to change the configuration with an update. If the game build is for Steam, the plugin configures Steam to be the target of your custom URI instead of the game (this is done to work around DRM) but configures Steam to launch your game with the Uri that opened steam. Linux and Windows builds (Steam or Standalone) can't be activated via a Deep Link after the game is already running. This is because the link activation information is passed via argument on the main function, making it impossible to get information of the activation link after the game is already running. To work around this issue check the section below Standalone activation after launch \u00b6 Although not included with the plugin, it's possible to work around the activation issue. In order to do that it's required that another application (Launcher application) is registered as the target for the deep link and that activation is responsible to launch or notify your app or game. So instead of the normal activation flow: It will run like the following The Launcher application is not included in the plugin for security and liability reasons, so you would need to develop it yourself and include it on your game/app final package. We do however have an API for enabling this kind of behavior. First off, you would need to register the launcher application instead of your app/game as the target application for the plugin, in order to facilitate that we enable you to override what we register as the deep link target, your app/game executable or another application. In order to do that, before you register your callback on the LinkActivated event you need to set the DeferredExePath field with the full path of the application. #if UNITY_STANDALONE_LINUX || UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . LinkProviderFactory . DeferredExePath = \"<Launcher application full path>\" ; #endif ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated += Instance_LinkActivated ; Then you need to implement a bridge between the Launcher application and your app/game, for this situation any common Inter Process Communication tools or APIs can be used, you can as an example use, Files , Sockets or Pipes . Using the file polling as an example, the launcher application would write the activation URI on a file that both the launcher and your app/game knows. The game would then on set intervals check if a specific file was changed when it was changed the app/game would read it in order to get the activation URI. After getting the URI the app/game could use our manual trigger API in order to activate the LinkActivated event: while ( true ) { if (< file was modified >) { string fileContent = System . IO . File . ReadAllText (< file path >); ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance . ManuallyTriggerDeepLink ( fileContent ); } } The launcher application needs to check if the app/game is open or not before deciding which method it would use in order to send the activation data to it. If the application is not running, you can simply launch it and pass the activation URI as an argument. If the app/game is already running, you need to IPC in order to send information to the running app/game. Using the file polling example again, the launcher application code can be something like: void Main ( string [] args ) { if ( args . Length == 0 ) return ; // Get the activation uri. var uri = args [ 0 ]; // Check if your app/game is running if ( Process . GetProcessesByName ( \"<your app/game>\" ). Length == 0 ) { //if not simply launch it with the activationUri as argument Process p = new Process (); p . StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo ( \"<path to app/game executable>\" , uri ); p . Start (); } else { // // Write in the share file the uri so that the app/game can extract it // File . WriteAllText ( \"<Path to shared file between launcher and game>\" , uri ); } } Mac \u00b6 All manifest registrations are handled by the plugin, the deep linking activation is deferred from our library into the game as it happens, so MacOs builds won't have the caveats that Windows and Linux have. In order to support Deep Linking we had to make a library ( UniversalDeepLink.framework ) that would intercept the activation events of the application itself since Unity doesn't allow the plugin to automatically link a library on the build process it must be done after the build. To make that possible the plugin includes the tool optool . optool allow us to inject the library into the game and collect all the activation events. If you build your game on MacOs the plugin will automatically call optool and inject the library. If you make the build on any other OS you will need to make an extra step, just has explained on the Getting Started Section . This requirement exists because optool was made for MacOs and the team couldn't in useful time port it to Windows.

But if your game is on Steam you are probably using its SDK or DRM capabilities to further enhance your players' experience. If you open a Steam game from its installation folder, since it wasn't open via steam it probably won't be able to communicate with valve software in order to report achievements, stats, etc, or it won't simply launch due to the DRM feature. So using the regular Deep Linking mechanism where we associate a custom URI to a game executable wouldn't work since the game would possibly lose functionality or simply wouldn't start. To avoid this issue, instead of registering your game to your custom URI, we configure the target systems to open steam instead of your game, but we parameterize Steam to open your game as soon as it's initialized. Configuring Steam Integration \u00b6 To enable the Steam capability of ImaginationOverflow Deep Linking Plugin you first need to have a valid app id, for that you need to get access to Steam Direct . After that valve will attribute to your game an ID. As an example, Sudoku Zenkai id is 809850 . Then you need to configure the plugin with this id: The final step of the configuration to enable the Steam integration is setting the IsSteamBuild Property under DeepLinkManager : ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance .

UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance . IsSteamBuild = true ; #else ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . DeepLinkManager . Instance . IsSteamBuild = false ; #endif Mac and Steam Integration \u00b6 Mac Deep Linking works a little different from the Windows and Linux, you have to take special care when integrating the plugin with Mac and Steam. On Linux and Windows, the plugin handles the registration of the Deep Link when the game is first open. This enables the plugin to register whatever it wants on these platforms. On Mac, the Deep Link feature is fully controlled by the OS and the plugin can't change the default configuration, which opens your game directly. The OS itself doesn't know that is running a Steam game, so when the user clicks on a custom URI, the OS opens the game executable. This means that you need to explicitly delay the enforcement of the DRM until you know if the game was activated via Deep Linking or not. The plugin is configured in a way that when it's running a Steam game on MacOS it will always fire the LinkActivated event even if the game wasn't activated via Deep Link. This way is possible to store the Deep Link before enforcing any DRM in the game. Solution Suggestion \u00b6 Below is the code that we use on Sudoku Zenkai to handle this tricky issue, for Steam integration we are using Steamworks.NET . The user flow for this situation is the following: User clicks on a Deep Link. The game opens The game enforces DRM and launches the game on Steam. Steam launches (if not already running). Steam launches the game. To ensure that we process the Deep Link that the user initially clicked we need to save it before enforcing the DRM, in the code below we do exactly that: The game is activated via Deep Link. The LinkActivated event is triggered. Save the link information (since it's impossible to have the game launch on steam via Deep Link) Check if the game has steam access, if not restart. If we are already on steam, load the previously saved Deep Link Resume Deep Link activation. This behavior is only possible because the plugin always triggers the LinkActivated event (on Steam Mac builds) regardless if it was activated via a Deep Link or not. public void RegisterForActivation () { #if UNITY_STANDALONE_OSX && STEAM_BUILD DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated += SteamOsxActivation ; #else DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated += Instance_LinkActivated ; #endif } private void SteamOsxActivation ( LinkActivation s ) { // // On Steam OSX builds the plugin triggers the LinkActivated with the // deep link data or with a null Uri if it wasn't activated // via Deep Linking // if ( string . IsNullOrEmpty ( s . Uri ) == false ) YourGameStorage . SaveDeepLinkActivation ( s ); // // Enforce DRM // if ( Steamworks . SteamAPI . RestartAppIfNecessary ( new Steamworks . AppId_t ([ YourAppId ]))) { Application . Quit (); return ; } // // We are already running on Steam, so load any saved deep linking // activations // s = YourGameStorage . LoadDeepLinkActivation (); if ( s == null ) return ; // // Clear the activation ensuring that the game won't be activated again // with the same uri this depends on your storage infrastructure. // YourGameStorage . ClearDeepLinkActivation (); // // Process deep link activation // Instance_LinkActivated ( s ); } This behavior only happens when the game is running on Mac and you set the Steam flag to true, on the other combinations the plugin only fires the LinkActivated event in case of an actual activation.","title":"Steam Integration"},{"location":"SteamIntegration/#configuring-steam-integration","text":"To enable the Steam capability of ImaginationOverflow Deep Linking Plugin you first need to have a valid app id, for that you need to get access to Steam Direct .

The plugin is configured in a way that when it's running a Steam game on MacOS it will always fire the LinkActivated event even if the game wasn't activated via Deep Link. This way is possible to store the Deep Link before enforcing any DRM in the game.","title":"Mac and Steam Integration"},{"location":"SteamIntegration/#solution-suggestion","text":"Below is the code that we use on Sudoku Zenkai to handle this tricky issue, for Steam integration we are using Steamworks.NET . The user flow for this situation is the following: User clicks on a Deep Link. The game opens The game enforces DRM and launches the game on Steam. Steam launches (if not already running). Steam launches the game. To ensure that we process the Deep Link that the user initially clicked we need to save it before enforcing the DRM, in the code below we do exactly that: The game is activated via Deep Link. The LinkActivated event is triggered. Save the link information (since it's impossible to have the game launch on steam via Deep Link) Check if the game has steam access, if not restart. If we are already on steam, load the previously saved Deep Link Resume Deep Link activation. This behavior is only possible because the plugin always triggers the LinkActivated event (on Steam Mac builds) regardless if it was activated via a Deep Link or not. public void RegisterForActivation () { #if UNITY_STANDALONE_OSX && STEAM_BUILD DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated += SteamOsxActivation ; #else DeepLinkManager . Instance . LinkActivated += Instance_LinkActivated ; #endif } private void SteamOsxActivation ( LinkActivation s ) { // // On Steam OSX builds the plugin triggers the LinkActivated with the // deep link data or with a null Uri if it wasn't activated // via Deep Linking // if ( string . IsNullOrEmpty ( s . Uri ) == false ) YourGameStorage . SaveDeepLinkActivation ( s ); // // Enforce DRM // if ( Steamworks . SteamAPI . RestartAppIfNecessary ( new Steamworks . AppId_t ([ YourAppId ]))) { Application . Quit (); return ; } // // We are already running on Steam, so load any saved deep linking // activations // s = YourGameStorage . LoadDeepLinkActivation (); if ( s == null ) return ; // // Clear the activation ensuring that the game won't be activated again // with the same uri this depends on your storage infrastructure. // YourGameStorage . ClearDeepLinkActivation (); // // Process deep link activation // Instance_LinkActivated ( s ); } This behavior only happens when the game is running on Mac and you set the Steam flag to true, on the other combinations the plugin only fires the LinkActivated event in case of an actual activation.","title":"Solution Suggestion"}]}
